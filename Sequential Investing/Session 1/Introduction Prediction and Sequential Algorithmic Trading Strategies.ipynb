    "Algorithmic Trading has has been the domain of large financial institutions for a long time, but now it has become accessible to retail algorithmic traders thanks to the fact that more and more trading platforms and brokers  allow their clients to use __REST APIs__ to programatically retirve data or streaming data, or to place buy and sell orders. In this space, __Python__ has secured a top position as a main programming language and technology platform. Among other factors, this is driven by the fact that many trading platforms provide easy-to-use ythn wrapper packages for their REST APIs."

    "Most Exchanges support a variety of orders that they accept from market participants. The most common are:\n",
    "- __IOC - Immediate or cancelled__. These orders never get added the Exchage trading book. They either match against existing resting orders to a maximum of the IOC order size, or thes rest of the incoming order gets canceled. If no resting order is available at a price that the IOC can match against, then the IOC is canceled in its entirety. IOC orders have the advantage of not resting in the book post matching and causing additional complexity with __order management__ in trading algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Good Till Day__. These orders get added to the book. If they match fully against existing resting orders in the book, then they don't get added, otherwise the remaining quantity on the order (which can be the original entire quantity if there's no partial match) gets added to the book and sits as resting orders that the incoming aggressors can match against. The benefits of GTD orders are that they can take advantage of FIFO matching algorithms by having better priorities than orders that just showed up in the book but require more complex order management in trading algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Stop Orders__. Stop orders are orders that aren't in the book until a specified price (called the stop price) is traded in the market, at which point they become regular GTD orders at a pre-specified price. These orders are very good as exit orders (either to liquidate a losing position or to realize a profit on a winning position)."

    "Slippage is defined as the difference in the expected price of a trade and the price at which the trade is actually executed. This can happen for predominantly two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the order reaches the exchange later than expected (latency), then it might end up either not executing at all, or executing at a worse price than you might expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the order is very large such that it executes at multiple prices, then the VWAP of the entire execution may be significantly deifferent from the market price observed when the order was sent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Slippage obviously causes losses that might not have been correctly factored in, in addition to difficulty liqueidating positions. As the position sizes for trading algorithm scale up, slippage becomes a larger problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fees are another issue with executing orders efficiently. Typically, there are exchange fees and broker fees proportional to the size of the orders and the total volume traded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, as the position sizes for trading algorithms scale up, trading volumes typically increase and fees increase along with it. Oftentimes, a good trading strategy can end up being non-profitable because it trades too much and accumulates a lot of trading fees. Again, a good execution logic seeks to minimize the fees paid."

    "### Backtesting!\n",
    "When researching an automated trading strategy for expected behavior, a key component in a good algorithmic trading research system is a good backtester. \n",
    "A backtester is used to simulate automated trading strategy behavior and retrieve statistics on expected PnLs, expected risk exposure, and other metrics based on historically recorded market data. The basic idea is to answer the question: given historical data, what kind of performance would a specific trading strategy have? This is built by recording historical market data accurately, having a framework to replay it and that can accept simulated order flow from potential trading strategies, and mimicking how a trading exchange would match this strategy's order flow in the presence of other market participants as specified in the historical market data. It is also a good place to try our different trading strategies to see what ideas work before deploying them to the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building and maintaining a highly accurate backtester is one of the most complicated tasks involved in setting up an algorithmic trading research system. It has to accurately simulate things such as software latencies, network latencies, accurate FIFO priorities for orders, slippage fees, and, in some cases, also the market impact caused by the order flow for the strategy under consideration (that is, how the other market participants may react in the presence of this strategy's order flow and trading activity).\n"
