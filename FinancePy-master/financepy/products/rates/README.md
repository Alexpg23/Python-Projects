# Funding

This folder contains a set of funding-related products. These reflect contracts linked to funding indices such as Ibors and Overnight index rate swaps (OIS). It includes:

## IborDeposit

This is the basic Ibor instrument in which a party borrows an amount for a specified term and rate unsecured.

### FinInterestRateFuture

This is a class to handle interest rate futures contracts. This is an exchange-traded contract
to receive or pay Ibor on a specified future date. It can be used to build the Liboir term structure.

### IborFRA

This is a class to manage Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) in which one party agrees to lock in a forward Ibor rate.

## Swaps

### FinFixedIborSwap

This is a contract to exchange fixed rate coupons for floating Ibor rates. This class has functionality to value the swap contract and to calculate its risk.

### FinFixedIborSwap - IN PROGRESS

This is a contract to exchange fixed rate coupons for floating Ibor rates. This class has functionality to value the swap contract and to calculate its risk.

### IborIborSwap - IN PROGRESS

This is a contract to exchange IBOR rates with different terms, also known as a basis swap. This class has functionality to value the swap contract and to calculate its risk.

### FinFixedOISwap - IN PROGRESS

This is an OIS, a contract to exchange fixed rate coupons for the overnight index rate. This class has functionality to value the swap contract and to calculate its risk.

### IborOISwap - IN PROGRESS

This is a contract to exchange overnight index rates for Ibor rates. This class has functionality to value the swap contract and to calculate its risk.

## Currency Swaps

### FinFixedFixedCcySwap - IN PROGRESS

This is a contract to exchange fixed rate coupons in two different currencies. This class has functionality to value the swap contract and to calculate its risk.

### IborIborCcySwap - IN PROGRESS

This is a contract to exchange IBOR coupons in two different currencies. This class has functionality to value the swap contract and to calculate its risk.

### FinOIS

This is a contract to exchange the daily compounded Overnight index swap rate for a fixed rate agreed at contract initiation.

### FinOISCurve

This is a discount curve that is extracted by bootstrapping a set of OIS rates. The internal representation of the curve are discount factors on each of the OIS dates. Between these dates, discount factors are interpolated according to a specified scheme.

### IborSingleCurve

This is a discount curve that is extracted by bootstrapping a set of Ibor deposits, Ibor FRAs and Ibor swap prices. The internal representation of the curve are discount factors on each of the deposit, FRA and swap maturity dates. Between these dates, discount factors are interpolated according to a specified scheme - see below.

## Options

### IborCapFloor

### IborSwaption

This is a contract to buy or sell an option to enter into a swap to either pay or receive a fixed swap rate at a specific future expiry date. The model includes code that prices a payer or receiver swaption with the following models:

- Black's Model
- Shifted Black Model
- SABR
- Shifted SABR
- Hull-White Tree Model
- Black-Karasinski Tree Model
- Black-Derman-Toy Tree Model

### IborBermudanSwaption

This is a contract to buy or sell an option to enter into a swap to either pay or receive a fixed swap rate at a specific future expiry date on specific coupon dates starting on a designated expiry date. The model includes code that prices a payer or receiver swaption with the following models:

- Hull-White Tree Model
- Black-Karasinski Tree Model
- Black-Derman-Toy Tree Model

It is also possible to price this using a Ibor Market Model. However for the moment this must be done directly via the Monte-Carlo implementation of the LMM found in FinModelRatesLMM.
