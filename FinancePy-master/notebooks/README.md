# Using FinancePy in a Jupyter Notebook

Once financepy has been installed, it is easy to get started.

Just download the project and examine the set of Jupyter Notebooks in this notebooks folder.

These have been organised according to the same directory structure as the project.

A pdf manual describing all of the functions can be found in the project directory.
